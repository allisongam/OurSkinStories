# OurSkinStories
This is my Fall 2023 semester project. It is my first attempt at building a functioning website.
I created this website for users with skincare needs and concerns. I am really passionate about this as someone who has struggled with their skin before.
I have included a community of influencers who share their skin journeys and give advice.
I have added a page for skincare product recommendations from their respective purchasing links.
